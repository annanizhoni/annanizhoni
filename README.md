# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋🏻

I am a student in the MIT xPro full-stack web development bootcamp. This portfolio will document my new path towards becoming a software engineer.
## 🚀 About Me
I am a polymath from Utah, but currently residing in New York City. I am a member of the Navajo Nation with a wide ranging skillset from fine art and classical piano to wilderness survival and auto mechanics. I found computer programming thanks to Google's user experience course. The elation from creating an interactive prototype for an art history app immediately sparked curiosity; how do I build it in its entirety from the ground up? That curiosity quickly morphed into obsession, and thus began my coding journey.

Fine art (charcoal portraiture, oil/acrylic painting, pinstriping), graphic design, classical piano, banjo, auto mechanics

Javascript, HTML, CSS, MERN stack, UX design, Figma, and Adobe Creative Suite
